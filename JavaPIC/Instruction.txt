How to control the simulation

The upper right panel lets you pick the paramers of the simulation (in non-dimensional, normalized units).

Mass 1, Mass 2: control the masses of particles in each of the beams. The masses control the particles' inertia.

Charge 1, Charge 2: control the charges of particles in each of the beams. The charges are responsible for the speed of interactions.

Timestep: controls the timestep of the simulation. A smaller timestep decreases the errors resulting from solving motion and field equations with their finite difference approximations, but slows down the simulation.

N/dx: particle density, the number of particles (in one beam!) per cell on the grid. Increasing N/dx will slow down the simulation as more calculations need to be done in each iterations.

Vinit - the initial velocity. Note that the phase plot scales with the initial velocity, so you won't see this changing right away - setting a huge initial velocity will make the duration of linear oscillations really long, though.

Grid N - the number of cells on the grid for calculating fields. A bigger N means increased precision of field calculations, but don't push it!

DeltaE - allowed tolerance of electric potential error. A smaller value will slow down the simulation as more iterations over the grid have to be made.

Scatter - the amplitude of the initial perturbation of particle distribution. A bigger value will accelerate the onset of the unstable phase. This may affect the number of vortices in the system.



Change parameters - runs the simulation with parameters set up above

|| or > - play\pause.

Restart - restarts the simulation without affecting its paremeters.

PL\EN - changes the language.

PrintScreen - saves the current state of the three plots at the localization of the .jar file. The names are generated automatically and should not get overwritten in each run.
